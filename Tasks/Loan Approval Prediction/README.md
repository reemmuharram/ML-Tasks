## ðŸ““ Content
- `loan-approval-prediction` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Data Exploration  
  - Data Cleaning 
  - Data Visualization (Pie Charts, Histograms, Count Plots, Correlation Matrix Heatmap)
  - Check and Clip Outliers at 1st and 99th Quantiles
  - Data Preprocessing (Encoding, Scaling)
  - Build a training pipeline for a Logistic Regression model, with the original imbalanced data. The pipeline is for scaling and training the model
  - Logistic Regression model evaluation, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix
  - Build a training pipeline for a Logistic Regression model, and resample the data using SMOTE. The pipeline is for scaling, resampling, and training the model.
  - Logistic Regression model (with resampling) evaluation, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix
  - Decision Tree model training, Evaluation, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix
  - A Dataframe to compare the performances of the 3 models, focusing on Precision, Recall and F1 Score

## ðŸš€ Summary
- Logistic Regression provides a solid and interpretable baseline.
- Resampling with SMOTE improves precision.
- Decision Tree achieves the best overall.
